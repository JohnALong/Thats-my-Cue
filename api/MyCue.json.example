      "aboutWrap": "A leather wrap is possibly one of the most noticeable upgrades that can be completed on a prized pool cue. Leather Cue Wraps are a great way to improve the grip and overall feel of your cue while also adding a touch of personal flare. Leather wraps come in a variety of finishes including bullhide, sharkskin, embossed lizard, eel skin, and ostrich."

      "name": "Wrapless",
      "aboutWrap": "Offers an extremely high level of grip.  The finish applied to the wood reacts with the sweat on your hands and causes them to stick to it. Some people may think that because it's like the shaft that it must be slippery, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Wrapless also affords the builder the opportunity to further stretch customization with different woods, inlays, and rings."

      "name": "Inlays Only",
      "aboutStyle": "When you want to take it to the next level, you can have inlays in your pool cue. Thatâ€™s when designs are cut into the wood, and different materials are used to fill those designs. The result is much more refined designs, and the potential to turn your cue into a real piece of artwork."

      "name": "Full Splice Points",
      "aboutStyle": "A full splice cue means that the points are milled at both ends and interlock with one another. The term FULL Splice means that the bottom portion of the point is one piece that extends to the length of the handle of the cue. This process is often seen in high-end custom cues and house cues. It is a very stable and strong construction method that requires special milling equipment and is not widely practiced. In fact, there are only a handful of cue makers out there that still use this method due to its costly and time consuming production process. That being said, you can bet that most full splice cues are expensive."

      "name": "Full Splice Butterfly",
      "aboutStyle": " full splice cue means that the points are milled at both ends and interlock with one another. The term FULL Splice means that the bottom portion of the point is one piece that extends to the length of the handle of the cue. Butterfly construction is an extra layer of complexity in that the points are reversed into the handle of the cue leading to rounded ends that bring to mind the wings of a butterfly. It is a very stable and strong construction method that requires special milling equipment and is not widely practiced. In fact, there are only a handful of cue makers out there that still use this method due to its costly and time consuming production process.
